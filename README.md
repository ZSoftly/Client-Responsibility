# ZSoftly Client Responsibility Towards a Smooth Interview Support Process

- Please make sure that Zsoftly is subscribed to your calendar so we can keep track of your interviews. Also, confirm that you always receive Google Meet invites to shadow other interviews.

- You should apply for as many  jobs as you can every day on various platforms. The more interviews you get, the higher your chances of getting a job offer. So it would be best to put extra effort into the job application. You should only apply for roles like Cloud Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Built and Release Engineer, DevSecOps Engineer, Operations Engineer,  Infrastructure Engineer and Automation Engineer. Zsoftly will not take or shadow you for an interview with a job title different from those listed above.

- When you get an interview request, you should ask the interviewer about the number of rounds, what each round covers, and whether the role is remote, hybrid, or onsite. Send the answers to these questions to the Slack channel with you, Godson, and Ditah. Your interview will not be scheduled without this information.

- It’s always better if the interviewer gives their availability first so we can pick the best time that works for us. If we send our availability and the interviewer accepts it hours later, that spot might already be taken by someone else on our calendar, and you’ll have to reschedule—which we want to avoid by preferring you ask the interviewer for their availability.

- Remember, it's your responsibility to schedule interviews on your calendar. We’ll see it on our end since we’re subscribed to your calendar. This helps us stay in sync with your interview schedule.

- Always use the group Slack channel with you, Godson and Ditah to schedule your interviews or for any updates concerning your interview.

- Zsoftly does not do take-home assignments or tests from interviews because those kinds of interviews hardly end with an offer.

- Just a quick reminder: always send us the job description link and a link to your resume at least an hour before your interview. This helps us avoid losing the link in chats and ensures we’re prepared to support you properly.

- Don't forget to share any important info from your past conversations with the interviewer or details from a previous interview.

- If anything in our process is unclear, let me know, and I’ll gladly schedule a one-on-one call to explain further. Your feedback on what we’re doing well and what we can improve is also much appreciated.

Thanks!
